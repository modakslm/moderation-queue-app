### Authentication

A basic login system is implemented to simulate moderator access.

- Users must **enter a username** to log in.
- The username is stored in `localStorage` to persist sessions.
- Once logged in, users can access the moderation queue.
- No logout or backend authentication is used â€” it's a mock flow as per assignment requirements.

## Features

- List of reported posts with clear details (title, user, reason, time)
- Approve/Reject individual posts
- Batch operations with select all, approve selected, reject selected
- Status filter tabs (Pending, Approved, Rejected)
- Content preview modal with post details
- All actions persist using localStorage
- Responsive layout for desktop and tablet
